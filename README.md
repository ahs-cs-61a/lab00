# lab00

instructions for setup in Replit:

1. import GitHub repository for each lab into Replit (make sure the repository is public on GitHub - you have to pay on Replit to import private ones)
2. go to shell and run "pip install -U pytest" to install pytest code tester (auto-tester)
6. share your Replit project with "Robertian23"
7. run auto-tester for each question using command: pytest ahs_lab0x_qx_test.py, MAKE SURE YOU ARE IN THE DIRECTORY WHERE YOU CAN SEE ALL THE TEST FILES


debugging/reading failed tests:

the red highlight is the failed case; the left side of the "==" is the output of your function, and on the right is the correct output - you can see the function call on the line before
the "Captured stdout call" window is the result of your print statements
