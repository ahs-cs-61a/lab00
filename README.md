# lab00 (introduction)

WELCOME TO CS61A AT AHS!

CS61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs is an "introductory" CS course at UC Berkeley that succeeds CS10 (AP CSP equivalent, what Mr. Morris used to teach at Cal). It is a challenging and fast-paced course that starts to delve deeper into more complex algorithms and structures of CS using Python.  
  
In CS61A at Cal, they teach multiple languages other than Python (e.g. Scheme, Regex, SQL), but at AHS, we will focus on Python.  
UCB EECS has course websites archives available to the public, including lecture slides, HW, labs, discussion worksheets, and projects. We have adapted this course at AHS from the 2022 summer session, so they may not match other semesters' curriculum. Most of the lab problems are made by 61A course staff, but most answer keys are made by me (Robert Tian :)).  
  
This is a great opportunity to learn new topics and techniques that are not present or harder to implement in OOP languages such as Java. After CS61A, there is 61B and 61C, which explore data structures and computer architecture, respectively. I hope you enjoy this course!
