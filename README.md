# lab00

instructions for setup in Replit:

1. create new Python project in Replit for all projects
2. go to shell and run "pip install -U pytest" to install pytest code tester (this is the auto tester)
3. download files in each lab repository and unzip/extract zip file
4. drag folder into Replit project
5. enter folder and drag assignment file "ahs_lab0x.py" (this is where you will do all of your coding) into "ahs_lab0x_qx_test.py" (the x represents whatever number that file is)
6. share your Replit project with "Robertian23"
7. run auto-tester for each question using command: pytest ahs_lab0x_qx_test.py


debugging/reading failed tests:

the red highlight is the failed case; the left side of the "==" is the output of your function, and on the right is the correct output - you can see the function call on the line before
the "Captured stdout call" window is the result of your print statements
