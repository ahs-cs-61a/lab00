# Background of CS61A at AHS

In my senior year of high school, Mr. Morris and I built this course structured like CS61A. I took the course in the summer of 2022 --- the summer after my junior year at AHS --- after taking AP CSA. It was a struggle for me; I spent 40 hours on CS per week; I did very poorly on the final, but clutched up with an A in the end. But we have adapted this course to best fit a continuation of CSA. I did not write the problems or tests, I just combined them into lab assignments, which require an auto-tester that we wrote to test. If the problems seem difficult, don't worry, I was in the same position at some point, and I've completed all the questions that I put onto here. This course is a project that I worked on to develop my own skills, but also to provide an opportunity for others to pursue an interest. I hope this course will still be taught after I graduate, but regardless, this is a piece of legacy that I have left behind. Enjoy!
